# customized-tailwinds-boilerplate
personal boilerplate that includes custom lit components and taikwind classes that are common in my projects such as components for intersection observation and dropdown menus.
the more i use this the more people will probably skid my components so i wont even bother trying to prevent it. If you do i advise leaving a star so people will find this more easily
